#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**

Software engineering is a field focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems.
Importance of Software engineering are:-
i). Ensuring high quality siftwares.
ii). Handling complexity 
iii). Ensuring security and compliance.
iv).Improving efficiency and reducing costs.
v). Facilitating information.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

i). Introduction of structured programming in 1960s- This emerged as a solution to tackle the challenges of developing and maintaining large software systems.It involves the concept of breaking down programs into smaller, more manageable, and reusable modules or functions.

ii). Developing of waterfall models methodologies.The Waterfall Model formalized the process of software development into distinct phases with specific deliverables and reviews. This approach brought discipline to the software development process, allowing for better planning and resource management since it does not allow the designer to go to the next phase qithout completing the current phase 

iii). The rise of agile methodologies.-Agile promotes iterative development, where software is built incrementally with continuous feedback from stakeholders.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

i) Requirement analysis -Gathering and analyzing user needs and requirements to define the system's functionality and constraints.

ii). Design stage- Creating architecture and detailed designs for software components, focusing on modularity, reusability, and scalability.

iii). Implementation- Writing code in various programming languages to build the software according to the design specifications.

iv). Testing-Verifying and validating that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

v). Maintenance-**: Updating and improving the software after deployment to fix bugs, add new features, and adapt to changing requirements.

6. Project Management- ut is the stage where Planning, scheduling, and overseeing software development projects to ensure they are completed on time and within budget.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
 #1 Development Approach
 -In waterfall methodology  a linear, sequential approach is followed where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. The stages are fixed (each stage having a specific set of deliverables and deadlines. There is little room for revisiting previous stages once they are completed.)

-In agile methodology we use iterative and incremental approach whereby development is done in small increments (called sprints or iterations), typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Has flexible stages ( allows revisiting and revising stages as needed. Development is adaptive, with constant feedback and refinement throughout the process.)

#2 Flexibility and adaptability 
-The Waterfall model is less flexible due to its rigid structure. Once a stage is completed, it is difficult and costly to go back and make changes. It is change resistance (changes made after the design has started may lead to significant delays and increased costs).
-In agile methodology Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and feedback, allowing for adaptability throughout the project. Here change is embraced to better meet user needs and market conditions.

#3 Planning and documentation
-The Waterfall model requires comprehensive planning and documentation at the beginning of the project. it also empasizes on extensive documentation in each design phase.
- Agile requires  “just enough” documentation to facilitate development and ensure clarity. It emphasizes on  team collaboration over comprehensive documentation, promoting regular communication and stakeholder involvement.

#4 Customer involvement and feedaback
-Waterfall allows minimal customer involvement thus ensuring customers see the product only at the end of the development cycle, which can lead to a mismatch between expectations and the final product.
-Agile encourages continuous customer involvement through regular reviews and feedback which allows frequent adjustments based on customer feedback thus ensuring the product aligns with customer needs and expectations.

#5 Project size and complexity.
-Waterfall is best for simple projects which are well defined and has low complexity.
-Agile is suitable for projects which are complex and whose requirements keep on changing with time according to the customer's preferences.

#6 Risk Management 
-The waterfall methodology has higher risk of failure Since the final product is delivered at the end of the project and might not meet customer expectations especially when the customer's requirements change. Since the mistakes are identified late it is very challenging to alter the risk without repeating the whole design cycle.
-Agile’s iterative nature allows for early and frequent testing and feedback, reducing the risk of building the wrong product. Risks are identified and adressed earlier allowing for timely adjustments and problem-solving.
Note: *Choosing between Agile and Waterfall depends on the project's nature, complexity, requirements, and the need for flexibility and customer involvement.*

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
#1 Software developer- Writes and maintain code based on software requirements, technical specifications, and coding standards. Write and maintain documentation for code, design decisions, and software architecture.
#2 Quality assurance engineer- Execute tests (the code written by tge software engineer) to identify bugs and ensure functionality, usability, and performance.Provide feedback and recommendations to improve the software development process, tools, and practices to enhance software quality.
#3 Project manager-Manage and coordinate the project team, including developers, QA engineers, designers, and other stakeholders. Facilitate communication and collaboration.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
