Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
* Software engineering is a field focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems.
Importance of Software engineering are:-
i). Ensuring high quality siftwares.
ii). Handling complexity 
iii). Ensuring security and compliance.
iv).Improving efficiency and reducing costs.
v). Facilitating information.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i). Introduction of structured programming in 1960s- This emerged as a solution to tackle the challenges of developing and maintaining large software systems.It involves the concept of breaking down programs into smaller, more manageable, and reusable modules or functions.

ii). Developing of waterfall models methodologies.-**: The Waterfall Model formalized the process of software development into distinct phases with specific deliverables and reviews. This approach brought discipline to the software development process, allowing for better planning and resource management since it does not allow the designer to go to the next phase qithout completing the current phase 

iii). The rise of agile methodologies.-Agile promotes iterative development, where software is built incrementally with continuous feedback from stakeholders.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

i) Requirement analysis -Gathering and analyzing user needs and requirements to define the system's functionality and constraints.
ii). Design stage- Creating architecture and detailed designs for software components, focusing on modularity, reusability, and scalability.
iii). Implementation-**: Writing code in various programming languages to build the software according to the design specifications.
iv). Testing-Verifying and validating that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
v). Maintenance-**: Updating and improving the software after deployment to fix bugs, add new features, and adapt to changing requirements.
6. **Project Management**: Planning, scheduling, and overseeing software development projects to ensure they are completed on time and within budget.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
